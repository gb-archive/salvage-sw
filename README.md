# savage-sw

This repository is an historical mirror of very old software (from 1997 onwards) related to Game Boy development.

There's a similar repository where we are mirroring and savaging websites, txts and misc docs: [savage](https://github.com/gb-archive/savage).

Most release zip files are also extracted, facilitating search engines indexing those sources.

If you're looking to recent Game Boy development things, take a look at [Awesome gbdev](https://gbdev.github.io/list).
